## Skills
You must train the following skills before venturing into PI:
 - Command Center Upgrades (Level IV)
 - Interplanetary Consolidation (Level IV)
 - Remote Sensing (Level III)
 - Planetology (Level III)
 - Gallente Industrial (Level III)

## Items
 You must acquire the following items before venturing into PI:
 - Ephital (Gallente Transport)
 - Iteron Mark V (Gallente Transport)
 - Command Centers (one for each planet)
 
 The Command Centers are available through Corporation Contracts for free.
 You will find Corporation Contracts with a set of Command Centers, one for each planet in our null sec home.
 
 ## Examples
 Try to organize you PI colony as shown in the following examples:

## Procedure
Below you will find a step wise procedure to set up a basic PI manufacturing structure.

1. Load your Iteron Mark V with one Command Center of your choice,
2. In your Neocom access the Planetary View in the Business Menu,
3. Undock,
4. In the Planetary Colonies window, Right Click on a Planet Type equal to the Command Center Type that is in your cargo hold,
5. Left Click on "Warp to within 0 m",
6. In the Planetary Colonies window, Right Click on the planet you just warped to and choose "View in Planet Mode",
7. Click in "Scan",
8. Cycle through the materials available in the planet and evaluate which one of the materials is the one with most reserves (white color),
9. Click in "Build",
10. Deploy your Command Center (anywhere... it really doesnt matter),
11. Deploy an "Extractor Control Unit" on the edge of the material reserve you want to extract,
12. Commit your change,
13. Left Click on your "Extractor Control Unit",
14. Select "Survey for Deposits",
15. Select the material you found in step 8,
16. Commit your change,
17. Left click in each one of the extractor heads so they pop up in the map,
18. Set your timer to 2 days,
19. Place your extractor heads apart within the white area,
20. While moving your extractor heads around, try to observe the effect of your placement in the "Program Output", a good output for a 2-day period is a Total of 2.000.000 units (this is the number you want to maximize),
21. "Start Program",
22. Commit your change,
23. Build a Storage Facility as close as possible to your Extractor Head but outside of the white area,
24. Commit your change,
25. Build several "Basic Industry Facilities" around your Extractor Head,
26. Commit your change,
27. Link your "Extractor Head" to your "Storage Facility",
28. Upgrade the link between your Extractor Head and your Storage Facility,
29. Link your Storage Facility to each one of the Basic Industry Facilities you have built,
30. Left Click in each one of the Basic Industry Facilities and choose the Product you will manufacture based on the input material your are extracting in your Extractor Head,
31. Commit your changes,
32. Route the product from your Storage Facility to each one of the Basic Industry Facilities,
33. Commit your changes,
34. Build a Spaceport close to your Storage Facility,
35. Link each one of your Basic Industry Facilities to your Spaceport,
36. Commit your changes,
37. Route the output of your Basic Industry Facilities to your Spaceport,
38. Commit your changes,
39. Wait 48 hours for your cycle to finish,
40. In your Neocom access the Planetary View in the Business Menu,
41. Undock with your Epithal,
42. Access the Customs Office for the Planet you want to refresh your cycle,
43. Transfer the PI from your Spaceport to the Customs Office,
44. Repeat steps 42 and 43 for each planet,
45. Warp to each one of the Customs Office, access them and place the PI into your PI hold,
46. Dock,
47. While docked, In the Planetary Colonies window, choose "View in Planet Mode",
49. Select your Extractor Control Unit,
50. Left click on Survey for Deposits,
51. Left click on "Start Program",
52. Repeat steps 47 through 51 for each one of the Planets your have Command Centers.
