## Comms
Even though it is a rule to be on comms 100% of the time, it is important to understand why you should do it.
To be on comms is not an option and should not be, even if you do not want to engage in friendly conversations, you should know that most of the intel on neaby systems is presented first and foremost through comms, even though there is an intel channel (which is active nevertheless), you will know firsthanded through comms.

Moreover, you can be much more efficient in asking for help using your voice. Do not be shy on this, after all, it is not only about you, it is about other members as well.

In the **Services** section you will find information to set up your VoIP SW.

## Mission
Your mission as part of INFL is to keep our Military ADM as high as possible.
In order to increase our Military ADM you should perform your PVE activities in our local system.
Increasing our Military ADM has two direct consequences:
 - Increse the amount of PVE sites (anomalies) in the local system,
 - Increase our SoV Active Defense Multiplier (ADM).
 
**IMPORTANT:** If the Military ADM falls below level 1 the amount of PVE sites will drop to one (and this is something we do NOT want, right?)

## Local System
PVE operations should be executed in QTTP and 9M systems.

## Know your enemy (local rats)
To properly fight against your enemy you should gain knowledge of it. 
In our local system you will find several PVE sites associated with Angels presence.
Check [Eve Universisty](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/NPC_damage_types) for more details on damage and resistence profiles for each type of NPC/rats you might find in Eve. 
 
## Fittings
Your PVE fitting capabilities should focus in the following aspects:
 - Improve your Explosive Resistance,
 - Improve your Explosive damage,
 - Improve your Sensor Strength (optional if using drones).
  
 In order to fight against Angles it is recommended you make extensive use of Minmatar Drones (explosive Damage).
 Check this fitting here: **[PVE Solo Cruiser T1 v2.6 (Angels)](http://fleet-up.com/Fitting/Index/49960)**.
