## Corporation Advert

### Time zone
It is important to have as much as possible a corporation player base covering a 24h cycle, that said, there should be no restrictions in the corporation advert regarding time zones.

### Language
English and nothing else.

### Skill points
The corporation advert must set a minimum of 2 Million Skillpoints.

**Why not higher?**
It should not be higher than 2M skill points because higher than this would reduce the player base in NPC corps that we want to attract. It is difficult to find new members in NPC corps with more than 2M skill points unless these are alts of toons which are already in another corp.

**Why not lower?**
Skill points lower than 2M would represent a lack of game experience which would implicate in a lot of babysitting needed to avoid being killed in null sec, thus, bringing down our Killboard.

### Public Channel
The corporation advert must have a link to a public channel. This can be an in-game chat channel or a Discord public channel.

### Voice & Chat requirements
The corporation advert must clearly indicate that presence in the corporation or alliance voice chat environment is mandatory.
The corporation advert must indicate which software is used for cross-communication between corporation and alliance members.

### Recruiters
The corporation advert must clearly indicate who are the corporation recruiters.

### API
The corporation advert must clearly indicate the need for a FULL API disclosure from the applicant.
A link for the API standard form must be included in the corporation advert.

### Quick Access
The corporation advert link must be placed in:
1. the MOTD of the corp channel;
2. the Bio of each leadership corp member.

### Area of operations
The corporation advert must clearly indicate in which area the corp performs its operations, e.g., Pure Blind.

### Activities e incentives
The corporation advert must clearly indicate what are the activities in which the corp invest its time and ISK, examples:
1. Ore Buyback;
2. Moon mining;
3. PvE & PvP fleets;
4. PI coordination;
5. Customs Office tax rate;
6. Manufacturing & Research tax rate;
7. Corporation tax rate;
8. Free Venture ships to start your life in null sec;
9. Jump Freight services.
